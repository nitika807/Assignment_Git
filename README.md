# Assignment_Git

Here I have a repository named "Assignment_Git". It has three branches:
1. Main 
2. Feature_Nitika, and
3. Develop.
All the changes performed on files in "Feature_Nitika". To reflect those changes in the "Main" branch,
I have created a pull request and added reviewers. At least 3 approvals are required for successfully pushing content 
for i.e. "Main" <- "feature_Nitika".
